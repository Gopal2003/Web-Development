    <!DOCTYPE html>: This line tells the web browser that the document is written in HTML5.

<html lang="en">
    <!-- 
        <html lang="en">: This is the root element of the HTML document. The lang="en" attribute specifies the document's language as English. It is used to tell the 
            browser that the document is using english as its primary language i.e., primaty => dominant language
        Uses:
        Search Engines:                    Search engines use the lang attribute to identify the language of the document and potentially rank it in relevant language searches.
        Text-to-Speech and Screen Readers: Assistive technologies like text-to-speech tools and screen readers use the lang attribute to apply the correct pronunciation rules and grammar for the specified language.
        Browser Functionality:             Some browsers might use the lang attribute to suggest language-specific spell-checking or grammar tools.

    <!-- 
        <meta charset="UTF-8">: This meta tag defines the character encoding of the document as UTF-8, which allows for proper display of various characters.

        What is character encoding?
        Answer: Character encoding, in the context of HTML documents, refers to the method used to represent characters digitally. It essentially translates characters you see on the 
        screen (like letters, numbers, symbols) into a format that computers can understand and process.

        Why UTF-8?
        Answer:
        Universality: UTF-8 is a versatile encoding that can represent a vast range of characters from nearly all languages around the world. This makes it ideal 
        for displaying multilingual content on a web page.

        Backward Compatibility: UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), the earlier encoding standard that 
        primarily dealt with English characters. This means that all ASCII characters (letters, numbers, basic symbols) are also valid UTF-8 characters.

        UTF-8 uses a variable number of bytes (1 to 4) to represent a character. This efficiency allows it to handle a wider range of characters compared to 
        fixed-length encodings while remaining relatively compact.

        Uses:
        Accurate Display: UTF-8 ensures that characters from various languages are displayed correctly on web pages, preventing garbled text or missing symbols.

        Multilingual Support: It allows websites to cater to a global audience by displaying content in different languages seamlessly.

        Simplified Development: By using UTF-8, developers don't need to worry about compatibility issues with different character encodings, making web development 
        more efficient.

        we can also write name="Anyport" as it is the convention to know the developer about the tag.
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This meta tag is important for responsive web design. 
        It instructs the browser to adjust the document's width to the size of the device screen and sets the initial zoom level to 100%.

        BreakDown of each attribute:

        name="viewport" Attribute:

        This attribute specifies the name of the metadata being provided. In this case, "viewport" indicates that the following information 
        relates to how the document's viewport should be handled.

        content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" Attribute:

        This attribute defines the actual metadata content. Here, it's a single value with two comma-separated instructions for the viewport:
        width=device-width: This tells the browser to set the viewport width equal to the width of the device's screen. This ensures the webpage adapts to different 
        screen sizes.
        initial-scale=1.0: This sets the initial zoom level of the webpage to 100% when it first loads. This avoids any unwanted scaling issues.
